# My Way To Coding (2022)

This is a log of my way (back) to coding in 2022.

## Intro
In 2017, during my maternity leave, I came across web development and I decided to learn how to build webpages from scratch. When I later came to JavaScript, I was excited even more. I love to think about what needs to be done, plan how to do it, how to divide it into smaller logical chunks, how these influence each other. 

I wanted to see also the bigger picture and understand how all the things work together, so I learned also basics of other connected technologies on the backend. 

I learned mostly from online courses (Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy and others), in-site courses (mostly by Czechitas) and attended frontend-meetups. 

During my way I learned:
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass
- JavaScript
- React
- JQuery, Bootstrap, Tachyons
- Git & GitHub
- CommandLine
- Node.js, Express.js
 
And also basics of:
- Gulp, Webpack
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Java

In 2019 (at the end of my maternity leave) I planned not to go back to my previous work at the university, but I intended to change my career and go to the world of coding. However, I got an offer to another work-challenge, so I went for it and (for the time being) left the idea of IT. 
However, I still felt attracted to coding and 3 years later (at the end of April 2022) I got back to it with the plan to revise and expand my knowledge of this topics and to accomplish my plan of a career change. 

## April 2022 (last week of April)
I revised the basics of HTML and CSS, and also the theory of JavaScript. 
I decided to create my own project: [LOGIC-game](https://github.com/marieval/logic-game). (It´s a favorite board game of my son, so I decided to create an electronic version of this game.)

**LOGIC-game:**
- I started by simple HTML & CSS, created the wireframe of the JS-logic needed for the game and started the JS-logic and step-wise improved it.
- I was excited when I realized that after stumbling across some bugs I remember a lot of stuff and am able to find the bugs and solve the problems quite quickly.

## May 2022
- My [LOGIC-game](https://github.com/marieval/logic-game) is working great, but I still have ideas how to improve it, so it´s not finished yet.

### 2/5/2022 (Mon)
- I improved my [LOGIC-game](https://github.com/marieval/logic-game): Added *modal* at the end of the game. Improved some *CSS*.

### 3/5/2022 (Tue)
- I added the action after clicking *New Game* button in my [LOGIC-game](https://github.com/marieval/logic-game) (At first I tried to avoid reload and instead to re-set all the conditions to the initial state, but there was always some issue, so in the end I solved it simply by reloading of the page.)
- I learned/revised part of *HTTP, AJAX and Promises*
