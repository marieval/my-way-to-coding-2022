# My Way To Coding (2022)

This is a log of my way (back) to coding in 2022.

## Intro
In 2017, during my maternity leave, I came across web development and I decided to learn how to build webpages from scratch. When I later came to JavaScript, I was excited even more. I love to think about what needs to be done, plan how to do it, how to divide it into smaller logical chunks, how these influence each other. 

I wanted to see also the bigger picture and understand how all the things work together, so I learned also basics of other connected technologies on the backend. 

I learned mostly with online courses (Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy and others), in-site courses (mostly by Czechitas) and attended frontend-meetups. 

During my way I learned about:
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass
- JavaScript
- React
- JQuery, Bootstrap, Tachyons
- Git & GitHub
- CommandLine
- Node.js, Express.js
 
And also basics of:
- Gulp, Webpack
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Java

In 2019 (at the end of my maternity leave) I planned not to go back to my previous work at the university, but I intended to change my career and go to the world of coding. However, I got an offer to another work-challenge, so I went for it and abandoned the area of IT. 
However, I still felt attracted to coding and 3 years later (at the end of April 2022) I got back to it with the plan to revise and expand my knowledge of this topics and to finish my plan of career change.
